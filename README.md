QuantiModo-WordPress-Plugin
=======================================

*NOTE: This plugin is in an extremely early stage of development and is not yet function. The roadmap for the development of the plugin is below. We'd be very grateful for any pull requests. Thanks!*

Help ignite a revolution of citizen science to find new solutions to chronic illnesses.  Install the Quantimodo Wordpress plugin!

This is a mobile-friendly WordPress plugin that enables users of any WordPress to authenticate and share their data from QuantiModo.com. It also allows you to embed dynamic graphs containing your users' Quantified Self data agggregated at QuantiModo.com. These graphs may be included in any page or post using shortcode.

Note: This JavaScript library (https://github.com/QuantiModo/QuantiModo-SDK-JavaScript/blob/master/quantimodo-api.js) is required for this plugin's functionality.

## Add QuantiModo Login Button

PURPOSE: 
The purpose of allowing users to log in via the QuantiModo API's OAuth2 endpoint is so that the WordPress site can obtain an OAuth2 access token which will be included in the Authorization header of all API requests to QuantiModo as a Bearer token. 

It is in this way that the user may authorize the QM API to obtain their data from other API's such as Fitbit, MyFitnessPal, Withings, etc. This is done using the Connect shortcode.

Once a user has authorized QuantiModo to obtain their data, the WordPress site can use the OAuth2 access token to also make API requests to the QM API in order to store new user supplied data or visualize their data on various graphs produced by the Timeline and Correlations shortcode. 

SETUP:
- Download and install the QuantiModo-WordPress-Plugin.
- Email api@quantimo.do to get an API client id and secret.
- Setup your QM API key/secret in the WordPress backend under Settings > QM-OAuth.
- Add the QM Login button anywhere to your site with the [qmoa_login_form] shortcode.

Once a user authorizes you to access their measurements, their OAuth access tokens will be stored and refreshed automatically. They will be able to continue to access their data through your site until they revoke access. 

For example:

[qmoa_login_form layout="buttons-column" align="left"]

*Possible shortcode attributes:*

- layout - determines whether to display the login buttons as links or buttons, stacked vertically or lined up horizontally. Possible values: links-row, links-column, buttons-row, buttons-column
- align - sets the horizontal alignment of the custom form elements. Possible values: left, middle, right
- show_login - determines when the login buttons will be shown. Possible values: never, conditional, always
- show_logout - determines when the logout button will be shown. Possible values: never, conditional, always
- logged_out_title - sets the text to display above the custom login form when the user is logged out. Possible values: any text
- logged_in_title - sets the text to display above the custom login form when the user is logged in. Possible values: any text
- logging_in_title - sets the text to display above the custom login form when the user is logging ing. Possible values: any text
- logging_out_title - sets the text to display above the custom login form when the user is logging out. Possible values: any text
- style - sets the custom css style to apply to the custom login form. Possible values: any text
- class - sets the custom css class to apply to the custom login form. Possible values: any text

### What still needs to be done for the Login Button to be complete
- OAuth access tokens need to be stored in the database (`wp_usermeta` table?) for each user.
- Refresh tokens should be obtained and stored when necessary

## Timeline Graph
Shortcode - [qm_timeline]

To see how it works:
- Create an account at https://quantimo.do
- Connect the Weather connector at https://quantimo.do/connect/ (using "62034" as your zip code if you're not on Earth and you don't have a location to enter.)
- Go to https://quantimo.do/analyze and select a variable to chart on the left. 

If you have any problems with this process, please submit a help request by clicking the "Feedback" tab on the right. 

The code to be used for this shortcode is here: 
https://github.com/QuantiModo/QuantiModo-WordPress-Plugin/tree/develop/reference/timeline-page

### What still needs to be done for the Timeline Graph to be complete
- API requests should include Bearer access tokens from `wp_usermeta` table in the Authorization header of all API requests. - If user receives a "Not Authenticated" response from the API, the QuantiModo OAuth login dialog should popup or user should be redirected there and redirect back after logging in and authorizing access. 
- Refresh tokens should be obtained and stored when necessary
- Code from WP custom template needs to be available for embed as a shortcode

## Correlation Charts
Shortcode - [qm_correlation_charts]

This shortcode would allow one to create a widget or shortcode for embedding a Highcharts longitudinal timeline, correlation scatterplot, or correlation listing bar graph in posts, pages, custom post types, and sidebars.  Variables, settings, and filters are supplied when creating a the widget or shortcode. The charts would also include a the ability to add or remove variables.

To see how it works:
- Create an account at https://quantimo.do

## Add a Measurement Button
Shortcode - [qm_add_measurement]

This would create an "Add a Measurement" button which produces a popup similar to the the QuantiModo Chrome extension that allows a user to submit a measurement. 

How to Record a Measurement

1. CLICK THE EXTENSION - Click the QuantiModo icon in the upper right hand side of your browser. It might be hidden. In that case you'll have to drag the divider line to the right of the URL field to see it.
2. SELECT A VARIABLE - Type the name of the variable that you want to track. If it's an existing variable, the settings should be populated automatically and you can move to step 3. If you've never entered data for that variable before you'll need to adjust the settings for that variable first
3. ADD YOUR MEASUREMENT - Then enter the value for the measurement and select the correct units.
4. SEND YOUR MEASUREMENT - After pressing the "ADD" button data is then sent to https://app.quantimo.do/.

## Correlation Search Box
Shortcode - [qm_correlation_search]

Demo: https://quantimo.do/qm-search

This plugin creates a new WordPress page that allows one to search for:
- The strongest predictors of the severity of any given condition
- The most strongly predicted effects of any given stimulus

The results are based on the average predictive correlations for all QuantiModo users. 

- The user should indicate if they want to search for the effects of 
- The user should type in characters 
- and have an autocomplete drop down with the top 5 variables with the highest correlations

If the entered variable "Crazy Ass Variable No One Ever Heard Of" doesn't exist:
```
Your search - Crazy Ass Variable No One Ever Heard Of - did not match any documents.

Suggestions:

Make sure all words are spelled correctly.
Try different keywords.
Try more general keywords.
```

*Possible shortcode attributes for correlation search:*
- searched-cause-variable - Instead of a search box, only a list of the effects of this variable are displayed
- searched-effect-variable - Instead of a search box, only a list of the causes of this variable are displayed
